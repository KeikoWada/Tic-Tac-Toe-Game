List technologies used.
- HTML
- CSS
- Jquery
- JavaScript
- AJAX

### Document your planning
I first made user stories and time schedules.
I first worked on HTML/CSS for the gameboard and worked on Jquery, AJAX.
After function is working, I then design with CSS for the rest.

### Problem-solving strategy.
I console to see which steps of function is working or what data is passing in the parameter.

### Unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
- using boostrap
